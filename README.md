# Rules

## Ban Evasion Is Not Permitted
If you are banned on one account in the community, and we find that you are evading the ban by using or creating an alternative account (“alt”), this will result in the alt being banned as well. All alts will stay banned, even if the primary account is unbanned.

## Discrimination Is Not Permitted
Any discrimination of any kind to any person, group, community, religion, race, gender, etc. is not tolerated, no matter the format (Post, gif, video, image, etc.). Discrimination against other fandoms, such as Furries, bronies, etc., is also not tolerated. Everyone is welcome here. Breaking this rule will lead to a ban.

## Do Not Harass Or Wish Harm Against Others
Sending threats of any form (Death threats, harassment, verbal abuse, threats of violence, etc.) are not allowed, nor tolerated in this community, and will lead to a ban.

## Do Not Harass The Moderators
Please do not spam a moderator of any kind. This includes asking the moderator team to feature a post, asking to become a moderator, harassment (see rule above), and other types of message spam. This can be seen as annoying as we are humans too, and this can lead to a ban.

## No Adult Content
Adult content of any kind is NOT permitted in this community. We want to keep it safe for all ages. Also, due to Game Jolt’s terms of service, Adult content is not allowed anywhere on Game Jolt, and as such you will be banned and reported.

## No Sharing Personal Information
Please keep any and all personal information to yourself. This is because there are many people on the internet who can take advantage of your personal data. Posting another person’s or other people’s information is considered doxing, and is strictly forbidden. Your post will be ejected and reported, and you will be banned from the community, should you post any personal information about yourself or others.

## Re-enacting Memes/TF2 Videos
As funny as it can be to re-enact memes or Team Fortress 2 videos, please keep re-enactments in the Memes channel (Labeled “Meems”). Do not worry if you accidentally post them outside of the meme channel, we will move it to memes for you. However spamming (see rule below) may result in a ban.

##No Spamming
Posting the same post multiple times in one or multiple channels within a short amount of time is considered spam. It is annoying, not just for us moderators, but also for other users trying to access the community. Your posts will be ejected and you may end up with a ban.

## Leaked Content
Please only post leaked content in the “Leaked Content Discussion” channel. ***DO NOT LINK TO ANY DOWNLOADS OR PUBLISH A DOWNLOAD. THIS WILL RESULT IN A BAN.*** Leaked content includes the leaked source code, and any maps, images, textures, models, etc.

## Appealing A Ban
Sometimes bans are falsely given. It happens, we all make mistakes. We have an appeal process. Please visit [this website](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5V_-EfJV8zkekOftAXHzVnCUZN28IHxplIRcuCfSEeReTUw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to file an appeal.

## Misc Rules

### No Venting/Ranting About Personal Life
Please do not vent or rant about your personal life. This community is supposed to be a fun place dedicated to Team Fortress 2, and its surrounding community. We understand life can be difficult or hard, and we understand that these posts are meant to help you feel better. However, please talk to someone outside the community, such as a close friend, or family member. Your post will be ejected if it breaks this rule, sorry.

### No Stealing Fan-art
Please do not download, and re-upload any fan-art, animations, or renders without proper permission of the original owner. Also keep in mind that the work of the author is their copyrighted work, unless otherwise stated. Please respect their copyright.

### Keep Unrelated content to #Random
We understand that you want to post stuff and sharing interests, but please, keep any unrelated posts in the Random channel. You will be given warnings and temporary bans that will eventually end up leading to a permanent ban. This community is dedicated to Team Fortress 2, and we don’t want to be janitors.

### Do Not Impersonate Other Users
Do not, under any circumstance, impersonate other users. Impersonation is taken very seriously. It does not matter if you are impersonating someone on Game Jolt, or from a different site. Parody accounts should be made clear. Any impersonators will lead to a ban, and you will be reported to Game Jolt staff. Identity theft is not a joke.
